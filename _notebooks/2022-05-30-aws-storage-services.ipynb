    "The <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/?nc=sn&loc=0\">simple storage service (S3)</a> is designed to store any type of data. It is a serverless service. Items in S3 are stored in buckets. As we add items to the buckets its size grows. In theory there is no limit on the size a bucket can get. We describe how to create a bucket in S3 via python in <a href=\"https://pockerman.github.io/qubit_opus/aws/s3-buckets/cloud-computing/data-storage/data-engineering/boto3/2021/11/11/aws-s3-buckets.html\">AWS.

Just like S3 is a serverless service. However, it is not as readily accessible as S3. Given this, typically Glacier storage is used for archiving data rather than storing data used on a daily basis."
