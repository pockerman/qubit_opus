    "Let's assume we have at our disposal a dataset $D$. We would like to be able to modify $D$ such that sensitive information about individuals within $D$ is not leaked. Let's denote the modified dataset $D$ with $\\hat{D}$. Modification of $D$ cannot be done recklessly because $\\hat{D}$ will not have any value in terms of performing analytics on it. Thus, anonymization, is about striking a balance between privacy and utility of the resulting anonymized set.  "
