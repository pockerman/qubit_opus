    "The k-nearest neighbor algorithm is one of the simplest algorithms performing both classification and regression modeling on data. Indeed, given a data set $D$ and a set of labels, the k-nearest neighbor algorithm does not explicitly train any particular mathematical model on $D$. Instead, it stores $D$ and every time a query comes in about the class of a point, $P$, the algorithm goes over the points in $D$ computes the $k$ nearest points to $P$ and uses a kind of majority vote in order to determine the class that $P$ should belong to. This is incredibly simple but this means that we need to compare $P$ with every point in $D$. Assuming that the metric we use is $O(1)$ time, the total time complexity is $O(|D|)$. However, this is just an ideal scenario. For a tuple with $N$ elements computing a distance requires $N$ operations. Hence, for one query point the complexity is $O(N|D|)$ and for $|D|$ query points we get quadratic behavior $O(N|D|^2)$ [4]."

    "So how can we improve this time complexity? The problem we face is that of searching in multidimensional data for the nearest neighbor(s) of a generic point $P$ that possibly is not in the dataset itself. K-d trees pose a way to solve this problem [3].\n"

    "A  k-d tree or a k-dimensional tree is a space partitioning data structure for organizing points in a k-dimensional space [1]. Specifically, a k-d tree is a binary search tree where every node in the tree represents a k-dimensional point [3]. We will assume that the coordinates of k-dimensional vector can be compared with each other. A non-leaf node in a k-d tree, implicitly generates a splitting hyperplane that divides the space into two parts, known as half-spaces [1]. Then all points to the left of the splitting hyperplane are represented by the left subtree of that node and points to the right of the hyperplane are represented by the right subtree [1]. The hyperplane direction is chosen by associating  every node in the tree with one of the $k$ dimensions.  K-d trees were proposed by  Jon Louis Bentley in [5]."

    "Nevertheless, the canonical method of of k-d tree construction is as follows. As we move down the tree, we cycle through the axes used to select the splitting planes. For our example, we could have the root node to have an $y-$aligned plane, root's children would both have $x-$aligned planes, the the root's grandchildren would all have again $y-$aligned planes an so on. This process is illustrated in the figure above we use point $R$ and its $x-$ coordinate to determine the first split and the two images below."

    "The second point of concern is how to choose the points to insert. Again in the canonical method, points are inserted by selecting the median of the points being put into the subtree, with respect to their coordinates in the axis being used to create the splitting plane. Of course the latter assumes that we know all points in advance. This method leads to a balanced k-d tree, in which each leaf node is approximately the same distance from the root [1]. Note. however,  that it is not required to select the median point; in this case however, there is no guarantee that the tree will be balanced [1]. "

    "In order to avoid coding a complex $O(n)$ median-finding algorithm or using an $O(n log n)$ sort e.g. heap-sort or merge-sort to sort all $n$ points, a popular practice is to sort a fixed number of randomly selected points, and use the median of those points to serve as the splitting plane. In practice, this technique often results in balanced trees [1]. "
