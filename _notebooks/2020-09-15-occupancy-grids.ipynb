    "Each cell in an occupancy grid indicates if the space represented by the cell is empty or occupied by an obstacle. Given this, the more dense the grid is the finer the representation of the environment will be. However, the more dense the grid is the more computationally expensive is to create it. Each cell in the grid is binary i.e. it has a value, $m_i$, of either one or zero [3]. "

    "In  occupancy  grid  mapping  every  grid  cell  is  one  of  two  states; occupied  or  empty [2].   But  in  some situations it makes sense for a cell to be partially filled.  This may occur when only part of the grid cell is filled and the rest is empty,  or when the objects that occupies the grid cell have special characteristics [2]. For example it may be that we  want a grid cell occupied with vegetation to be somehow less occupied than a grid cell filled with solid rock."

    "Semi-transparent obstacles and Mitigation Classical occupancy grids have trouble dealing with semi-transparent obstacles such as glass and vegetation.  These obstacles may return hits to the laser rangefinder about half of the time, but eventually the occupancy grid will converge to either occupied or not, both of which are incorrect. [2]"

    "A possible solution to this problem would be to consider a more continous measure that measures the density or probability of a beam to have reflected and not passed.  Perhaps the simplest approach towards this is to  treat  the  random  variable  as  a  biased  coin  and  for  each  state  keep  a  count  of  the number of hits and pass throughs [2].  Thus, the only difference is that each state tracks two numbers. Then, the probability can be calculated  empirically as the ratio of the hits to the sum of hits and passes.  For the inverse sensor model, we either spread the high probability zone or use fractional number of hits and misses for each state [2]."
