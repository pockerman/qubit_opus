    "Online Q-learning can experience instabilities during training. This is because by using experience sampled sequentially from the environment leads to highly correlated gradient steps. Deep Q-networks (DQN) made deep reinforcement learning a viable approach to complex sequential control problems.  In this section, we introduce the vanilla DQN algorithm. "

    "Deep q-networks were introduced in the seminal work of Mnih et al. in [2]. They demonstrated that a single DQN can achive human level performance in many Atari games without any feature engineerign. A DQN modifies online Q-learing in two ways [1, 2]"

    "Both these two features greatly stabilize the learning.  In particular, a DQN stores the experience tuples $(s_i, \\alpha_i, r_i, s_{i, NEW})$ in an experience buffer. During training, the  samples are drawn from the buffer uniformly. This approach eliminates the correlations between the samples used in training the neural network and gives i.i.d. samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second feature that a DQN introduces is the target network. When bootstraping with function approximations, in a sense we create a moving target to learn from. Attempting to train a neural network via such a route is more likely bound to fail. The key idea is to create a copy of the neural network that is only used to generate the Q-value estimates used in sampled Bellman updates. That is the target value for sample $i$ is obtained as "

    "Note that in the update rule above, $\\theta_{TN}$ denotes the parameters of a target network. These are updated every $C$ steps by setting them equal to the parameters $\\theta$ i.e. $\\theta_{TN} = \\theta$. Such an update rule, creates a lag in updating the target network which may make the action-value estimates that it generates a bit stale compared to the original network. What we gain, however, is that the target values become stable and the original network is trainable."
