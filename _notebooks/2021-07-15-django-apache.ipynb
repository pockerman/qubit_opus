    "To start with, the Django offcial documentation has most of the information you need <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/howto/deployment/wsgi/modwsgi/\">here</a>. The suggested way is by using ```mod_wsgi```. The problem that I had with that was due to a problem with SQLite that the project was initially using. I had to create a virtual environment on the server and install everything under the virtual environment. However, ```mod_wsgi``` only works with the version of Python it was compiled against. So if this is the case you may have to install the package in your environment. "
