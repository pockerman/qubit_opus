# About

Hi and welcome to my blog. This is Alex. I am a self-taught, at least to a large extent, software engineer. I am really intersted in
developing scientific applications (that do not involve drop down menus), mathematical modeling, machine learning and AI. I am also heavily interested in robotics,   <a href="https://github.com/pockerman/odisseus_raspberry_pi">here</a> is my non-working and still under-development-whenever-I-have-the-time, attempt. Admitedly, I still have  many thing  to learn.
In this blog, I write for myself, things that I work, or worked, on and find difficult to grasp, or things that I read and want to make
my understanding more tangible by...explaining them to myself. In any case, if you find useful any information in here, feel free to use it.

You can reach me, optional :), via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandros-giavaras-26233a5b/">Linkedin</a> or via <a href="https://github.com/pockerman">GitHub</a>.
